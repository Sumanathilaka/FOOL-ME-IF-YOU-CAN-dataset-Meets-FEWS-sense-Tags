The cell theory states that a cell is the basic unit of structure and function in all living things , and that every cell arise from pre-existing cell​ .
During the cell cycle , the cell passes through several stages including G1 , S , G2 , and M phases , which involve growth , DNA replication , preparation for mitosis , and division respectively​ .
When observing a cell under a microscope , you can see the cell membrane , cytoplasm , and various organelles such as mitochondria and the nucleus , which controls cell activities​ .
A cell is categorized into prokaryotic , which lack a nucleus , and eukaryotic , which have a well-defined nucleus and various organelles​ .
Each newly formed daughter cell from mitosis must grow and produce essential materials such as proteins and organelles during the G1 phase before entering the synthesis phase​ .
An Eukaryotic cell , which include animal and plant , contain mitochondria that supply energy to the cell and chloroplasts in plants that perform photosynthesis​ .
The cell membrane encloses the cell , maintaining its integrity and mediating interactions with the environment through transport mechanisms and signaling pathways​ .
A cell undergoes mitosis to ensure that each daughter cell receives an identical set of chromosomes , which is essential for maintaining genetic continuity​ .
The human body is composed of approximately 37 trillion cell , each specialized to perform various functions necessary for the survival and health of the organism​ .
Cell differentiation is a process where an unspecialized cell become specialized in structure and function , which is crucial during the development of multicellular organisms​ .
In the S phase of the cell cycle , the cell synthesizes a complete copy of its DNA , ensuring that both daughter cell will have the necessary genetic information​ .
The nucleus of a cell contains its genetic material in the form of DNA , which dictates the cell 's functions and regulates the expression of genes​ .
During the G2 phase , the cell continues to grow and produce proteins while also checking for any DNA damage before proceeding to mitosis​ .
The discovery of the cell by Robert Hooke in 1665 , and the subsequent development of cell theory , revolutionized our understanding of biological structures​ .
Stem cell has the unique ability to differentiate into various cell types , making it a focal point of regenerative medicine and research​ .
The cell membrane 's fluid mosaic model describes its structure as a flexible layer composed of lipids and proteins that can move laterally within the layer​ .
Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell because they generate ATP through cellular respiration , which is essential for energy-dependent processes​ .
Ribosomes , found within the cell , are responsible for synthesizing proteins by translating the genetic code from messenger RNA​ .
During cell division , spindle fibers form to separate sister chromatids , ensuring that each daughter cell receives an equal and accurate distribution of chromosomes​ .
The cell wall , found in plants , provides structural support and protection , and it is primarily composed of cellulose​ .
Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria , where glucose is broken down to produce ATP , the energy currency of the cell .
In multicellular organisms , every cell communicates with each other through chemical signals , which coordinate activities and ensure proper functioning of tissues and organs​ .
The Golgi apparatus in a cell modifies , sorts , and packages proteins and lipids for storage or transport out of the cell​ .
Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes that break down waste materials and cellular debris within the cell , playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular health​ .
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in the synthesis of proteins and lipids in the cell , with the rough ER being studded with ribosomes and the smooth ER lacking them​ .
Chloroplasts in the cell of a plant capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis​ .
The cytoskeleton provides structural support to the cell , facilitating movement and maintaining its shape through a network of protein filaments​ .
Apoptosis is a programmed cell death process that helps maintain the balance of cell numbers and eliminates damaged or dangerous cell​ .
The extracellular matrix surrounds the cell , providing structural and biochemical support to tissues and playing a role in cell signaling​ .
Cellular metabolism encompasses all chemical reactions within a cell , including catabolic pathways that break down molecules and anabolic pathways that synthesize new ones​ .
During embryonic development , the cell undergo rapid division and differentiation to form the complex structures and organs of the body​ .
Cancer occurs when a cell divides uncontrollably due to mutations in genes that regulate the cell cycle and apoptosis​ .
Hematopoietic stem cell in the bone marrow give rise to all blood cell types , continuously replenishing the blood supply​ .
The nucleolus , located within the cell , is the site of ribosomal RNA synthesis and ribosome assembly​ .
The plasma membrane 's selective permeability allows the cell to maintain homeostasis by regulating the movement of substances in and out of the cell​ .
Telomeres , the protective ends of chromosomes , shorten with each cell division and are associated with aging and cellular senescence​ .

As a biologist , he kept reading about mitosis and meiosis , while lying in his cell .
They tested his DNA and ran many experiments to match it with the person they had in the cell .
Although it was a cell , it had a telescope and many scientific devices to continue running their experiments .
They had a special cell for biologists , where many discussions about the DNA and chromosomes took place .
The cell wall was covered with text about nucleus , cytoplasm , and plasma membrane, which assured them that a scientist stayed there for a while .
The wall of the cell was covered with drawing to make it look like plasma membrane , he thought this will separate him from the outside world .
He used the years he spent in the cell by learning more about mutation of the nucleus until he got his PhD in microbiology .
They never understood why would a Biology professor visit their cell and give them a talk about metabolism .
His knowledge about metabolism served him well in the cell as he could maintain good nutrition and energy levels .
Since she was a science teacher , she spent her time in the cell teaching others about human body and chemical reactions .
He requested a book about mutation to his cell , but they refused as they didn't know what kind of experiments he was up to .
It was the only cell where scientific experiments took place , but only safe devices were allowed .
While everyone was watching the weekly movie , he stayed at his cell reading about DNA and enzymes , he wanted to major in Biology .
Due to the amazing knowledge she had in Genetic Engineering , many scientists would visit her in her cell to discuss scientific topics with her .
She had an exception to continue supervising the PhD from her cell , she was a professor in Microbiology focusing on mutation of the nucleus .
Sadly , by the time he finally won a Nobel prize for his work on nuclear division , he was lying in his cell .
When he started to talk about plasma membrane and nucleus , everyone in the cell thought he was crazy .
Like the atom is the main building block of matter , the cell can be considered as the main building block of prison .
His reputation and scientific discoveries are the man reason he is allowed to do experiments in his cell .
No chemical reactions are allowed inside a cell , it could be used as a way to cause mass explosion and escape .
He kept receiving letters in his cell from his student , telling him about the updates on their research on metabolism .
Her work on mitosis and meiosis was fascinating , that she was even treated nicely in the cell .
He always said that the time he spent in his cell was the inspiration to his groundbreaking work in Microbiology .
He finally published his book about cytoplasm and plasma membrane , after working on it in his cell for years .
Working on her scientific research in her cell wasn 't easy , but yet she was able to do it .
As the main suspect , they took a cell sample from him in prison to do the matching test .
Some cell types acts as a guard , that protects and secures the body from any attack .
In prison, the prisoners may undergo a cell test if needed .
The membrane of the cell isolates it and regulates what can go in it and what can go out of it .
A cell can be considered as the smallest unit in the body , just like in prison .
They held a scientific workshop in prison , where the prisoners got to know more about the cell .
A cell has many units and active processes and is protected by the membrane .
Whether the light can reach the cell has a great impact on its components .
To prevent the escape of anything from the cell , the membrane regulates what can go out .
After discovering the hole in the prison 's wall , they collected cell samples to identify the escaped prisoners .
The prison wasn 't a good place to live , he could feel each cell dying from oppression in his body .
He spent a long time in the dark prison that he wished that he could feel sunlight on a single cell in him .
The longer he stayed in prison , the more he felt that every cell is dying inside .
After spending a long time in solitary confinement , every cell in her eye burnt from sunlight when they set her free .
When the kid visited his father in prison , he gave him a diagram of the cell structure he learnt , the father was so proud and hung it on the wall .
After planning everything for the crime , the only incriminating evidence he didn't think of is a single sample of his cell .
He was imprisoned when his cell matched the DNA on the crime scene weapon .
As an attempt to improve the prison 's life , they started giving lessons to the prisoners , one of them was about the structure of the cell .
Although he never went to school before prison , he spent his time in jail reading , and he was fascinated to learn about different cell types in the prison 's library .
The time stood still in prison , but he found an escape from his solitude in scientific books , funnily enough , about the cell .
He was told that learning in jail might reduce his federal prison sentence , so he started reading about cell in the prison 's library , as he remembered learning about the it in school .
After being released from prison , he wanted to wash off his jail time of each cell .
The cold and darkness of the solitary confinement crawled into every cell in him , making him hate prison even more .
The other prisoners made fun of him for reading about the cell in a science book , the whole prison knew about it .
He was happy to teach other inmates in prison about the cell , he was after all a teacher before going to jail .
